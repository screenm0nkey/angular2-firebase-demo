# Github Note Taker - Angular2 Firebase Demo 

This sample application demonstrates use of the angular2-firebase package.
It's based on Tyler McGinnis' React app. I watched his tutorial and decided to build the same app with angular2.

[React version](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/github-notetaker-egghead)


It is based on:
* Angular 2
* angular2-firebase
* Observables (from RxJS 5 / RxNext, via Angular 2)
* Firebase
* Webpack

To run the demo locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```
